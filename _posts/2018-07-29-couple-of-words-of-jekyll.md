I've spent a lot of time in my life trying to setup various of CMSs. I started my development way from Mambo CMS. It was PHP-based CMS which was written one of web-studio that nobody remembers today but it was really famous and popular in millenium.

One day somebody from the web-studio decided to stop invest in a community and the community decided continue development under trademark Joomla. For today Joomla is one of the biggest CMSs in the world.

Then I had experience with lots of them. I have profesionally worked with Modx Evo and Modx Revo, with Wordpress, Drupal, PHP Nuke, OctoberCMS, m-cube, SavvyBox, AstroCMS etc. I even wrote 4 of my own CMSs more than 10 years and for today some projects have still worked using their.

But honestly if you wanna corporate site or personal blog today, you don't need all these CMSs with DB and PHP. Modern static site generators such as [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) enable you to do it the simliest way. Hosting of static files is also easy, you can do it without any services using only AWS S3.

And sure, all the guys who are starting something like ICOs today should look at static generators. Hosting their sites at Github may help them to be more opened for the community who could send pull requests to fix mistakes and typos.
