Today I have made up my mind having a personal blog to share of my thoughts and useful facts with the World. I'd like to start my blog from traditional _"Hello world!"_ =)

This blog is made by [Jekyll][jekyll-home] static site generator and hosted by [GitHub Pages][github-pages] which kindly give us opportunity to have static sites on its hosting.

You can ask me, "what exactly you want to share with me?" I would have write posts:

* About new technologies and tools I faced with
* Try to save my personal feed of "every day I should learn something new". Cause it will stimulate me learning even when lazy makes me to rest
* Keep useful links

Thank you for reading my blog. And of course **HELLO WORLD!**
