## Linux

### Web development

* [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) - Static site generator. It’s a tool which I use to write this blog. Don’t make some simple things difficult. Using static pages you can forget about the hell of wordpresses, joomlas etc.

### Console tools

* [Oh My ZSH!](https://ohmyz.sh) - This suit of plugins lets you make your ZSH usable asap.
* [TIG](https://jonas.github.io/tig/) - Name of this tool is reverted from _"GIT"_. It's a very cozy and useful console GUI for git which based on the preudographic. If you are spending your life in a console, you should try it
* [SpaceVim](https://spacevim.org) - You like vim but you think that it's a bit outdated for modern world? Try **SpaceVim** which enables you to get almost powerful IDE inside your console with autoupdating, beautiful fonts, really comfortable plugins etc. I hope you will like it.
